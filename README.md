### **🌍 About Me**

I'm a 14-year-old developer from **Belarus** with a passion for **creating** and **thinking outside the box**. I love turning ideas into working software — whether it's a clever desktop tool or a fresh web service.

Coding is not just a skill for me — it's a playground for creativity, problem-solving, and endless exploration.
